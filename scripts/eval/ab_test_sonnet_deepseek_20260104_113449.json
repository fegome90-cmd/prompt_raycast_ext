You have deep expertise in design systems, CSS-in-JS solutions (like Styled Components or Emotion), and modern frontend tooling.\n\n**Directive:** Design and implement a reusable, production-ready Button component in React with TypeScript that supports multiple variants (e.g., primary, secondary, outline, ghost, danger). The component must be fully accessible (WCAG 2.1 compliant), customizable via props, and optimized for performance. Provide a complete code implementation including:\n1. TypeScript interfaces for props.\n2. A base Button component with dynamic styling based on variants.\n3. Support for additional props like size (small, medium, large), disabled state, loading state, and icon support.\n4. Comprehensive unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library.\n5. Documentation with usage examples and a props table.\n\nUse a decomposition framework to break down the task into logical steps: first define the prop types and variants, then implement the core component logic, followed by styling and accessibility features, and finally testing and documentation.\n\n**Guardrails:**\n1. Ensure the component follows accessibility best practices: keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, focus management, and screen reader compatibility.\n2. Write clean, modular code with no hardcoded values; use constants for variant definitions and avoid inline styles.\n3. Optimize for re-renders and bundle size by memoizing where appropriate and using efficient CSS techniques.\n4. Include error handling for invalid prop combinations and provide clear console warnings in development.\n5. Support theming and customization via CSS variables or design tokens to integrate seamlessly into existing design systems.\n\n**Framework:** Decomposition",
