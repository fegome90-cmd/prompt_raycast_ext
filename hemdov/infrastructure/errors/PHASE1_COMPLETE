# Phase 1 Complete

All foundation components for error handling framework are implemented:

✅ Error ID Registry (19 unique Error IDs)
✅ Domain Error Types (DomainError, LLMProviderError, CacheError, PersistenceError)
✅ Result Type (Success with degradation_flags, Failure, helpers)
✅ ExceptionMapper (full context preservation, asyncio.TimeoutError support)

## Verification Results

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
✅ All error types serialize correctly
✅ Result pattern matching works
✅ ExceptionMapper preserves full error context
✅ All Error IDs are unique (19 IDs)
✅ Test coverage: 27 tests covering all new code
✅ Zero breaking changes to existing code

### Test Coverage
- hemdov/domain/errors: 5 tests (100% coverage)
- hemdov/domain/types/result: 10 tests (100% coverage)
- hemdov/infrastructure/errors/ids: 2 tests (100% coverage)
- hemdov/infrastructure/errors/mapper: 10 tests (100% coverage)

### Breaking Changes
None. All changes to existing files are minor import path fixes (main -> api.main).

### Pre-existing Test Failures
22 tests fail on both main and feat/error-handling-phase1 branches.
These failures are NOT caused by Phase 1 changes.
Root cause: Tests missing required 'mode' field in API requests.

Next: Phase 2 - Migrate critical paths (metrics_repository first)
